	If you want to run multiple MG applications under the same
	application name, change this value to something unique

	**SCAFFOLDING CONFIGURATION**
	
  If your application uses custom scaffolding settings, change this to set the location
	of your ScaffoldingConfiguration.xml file
	
	<cfset ModelGlue_SCAFFOLDING_CONFIGURATION_PATH = expandPath("/ModelGlue/unity/config/ScaffoldingConfiguration.xml") />

<!---
	**CUSTOM CORE CONFIGURATION**

  If your path to /modelglue/unity/config/Configuration.xml is custom, change it here.  Otherwise,
  it will default to /modelglue/unity/config/Configuration.xml

	<cfset ModelGlue_PARENT_BEAN_FACTORY = ??? />
